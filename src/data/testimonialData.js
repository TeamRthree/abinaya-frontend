    text: `I am incredibly grateful to Sairam Fertility and Maternity Clinic, Chennai, and especially to Dr. M.H.Abinaya, for their exceptional care, timely diagnosis, and expert treatment.

After months of uncertainty and inconclusive opinions, Dr. M.H.Abinaya correctly diagnosed me with a septate uterus‚Äîa condition that had previously gone undetected. Her clarity, compassion, and confidence immediately put me at ease.

What impressed me the most was the speed and precision with which everything was handled. From diagnosis to corrective surgery, the entire process was completed in a remarkably short span of time, with great care and professionalism. The post-surgical support was equally thorough and reassuring.

When I shared the details with doctors here in Canada, they were genuinely surprised‚Äînot only by the accuracy of the diagnosis but also by how efficiently the surgery had been performed. It truly reflects the world-class expertise and dedication of Dr. M.H.Abinaya and her team.

Thank you, Dr. M.H.Abinaya and everyone at Sairam Fertility and Maternity Clinic, for being a part of my healing journey. I would wholeheartedly recommend this clinic to anyone looking for expert fertility and maternity care in India.`,

We would not have been in a situation where we are gifted with twin babies a boy and girl with her support. She has the magical touch and positive vibe which was missed as we visited a lot of doctors before visiting her. Her positivity and clarity in explaining things , giving medicines , we always felt, we were in right direction. Her punctuality in seeing patients was at top notch and never gives overdose medicines. Whenever we ask doubt at any time, she responds immediately by whatsapp.
Her insta videos , pages too helped in explaining so many silly doubts which helped us throughout the journey. She never fails to even ask 2nd opinion and also do detailed study and research on complex cases and guides well which happened for us. I and my family would thank mam for bringing the little bundles of joy into our lives. Overall, we had an extraordinary experience with Dr. Abhinaya mam. She takes the time to get to know her patients on a personal level, asking about family, lifestyle, and any concerns in a way that feels genuine and caring. Her ability to listen attentively and provide thoughtful responses is something we greatly appreciate.Her ability to communicate complex medical information in an understandable and reassuring way was incredibly comforting.

Finally the clinic nurses were also very cooperative and on dot when it comes to appointment or in-clinic procedures.

We would certainly vouch for her medical treatment and her expertise to anyone who is planning pregnancy!

She is a true professional who genuinely cares about her patients, and we are grateful for the outstanding care she provided during this special time of our life. A BiG THANK YOU MAM üòä`,

She gives her best to make it as a normal delivery. The way she handled me in the labour room was beautiful. I‚Äôm not sure if other doctors would have been the same but she took the risk and entire responsibility to deliver my baby vaginally. The patience that she has is way beyond words. Only because of her my entire pregnancy journey was smooth and lovely. She made sure both the mother and baby are healthy even after delivery. She‚Äôs the one who can be trusted blindly even if you are consulting her for the first time. I kept my blind trust and hope on her and she proved it. Just listen to what she says and do the same throughout your pregnancy and you will see how beautiful your journey will be. ‚ÄúTHE BEST DOCTOR I WOULD SUGGEST FOR PREGNANCY & INFERTILITY ‚Äù. God bless her and her family :)`,

Without her guidance nothing would have been possible for me. I have visited a lot of doctors in the past and nothing helped me out. Abhinaya mam is just a magic that happened to me.
Right from the day one, when we started with our Pregnancy journey, she answered all our concern and queries politely with proper explanations. She even gave us moral strength when my wife had so much of pre natal depressions and would always listened to all our concerns with great understanding. She is available 24/7 over WhatsApp and answers our queries over chat also

I and my family would thank mam for bringing the little bundle of joy into our lives. She guided me through the third trimester to do the right workouts for my wife to ensure a safe and normal delivery. All those exercises helped me to have a hassle free normal delivery experience.

She guided me Post my delivery also.

Thank you so much mam for being throughout our journey and blessing us with our little treasure.

Overall we had an extraordinary experience with Dr. Abhinaya mam.

I would certainly vouch for her consultancy and her expertise to anyone who is planning pregnancy!

    text: `I have known Dr. ABINAYA for 4 years now and she‚Äôs definitely a life saver. During my second visit, she remembered my entire history and proceeded with the required treatment..I had visited a few doctors earlier and I bet nobody has done that(remembering a person‚Äôs entire complicated history just after a single visit ) and I highly doubt if anyone else would do that!!

No sugar coated words, no unnecessary false hopes or unnecessary scares and no unnecessary medication..She conveys the issue (if any)along with a solution and detailed counselling..

Nothing but positivity and a motherly care radiates in each visit.

Her 24 hour availability and answering immediately even to silly queries helped me a lot and gave me a great confidence throughout my pregnancy and even before that..
She clearly explains why each medicine is given and why each test is taken..

I doubted that we had an emergency situation during the second month of my pregnancy. It was quite late in the night and we contacted her and rushed to the hospital.She was there at the hospital even before we reached!! That‚Äôs Dr. ABINAYA!!A big salute for that care and dedication ü´°

Above all each time when I have an appointment with her, I never felt like visiting a doctor. It would feel like I‚Äôm going to visit a family friend and a well wisher.. that would summarise what kind of a doctor and a human she is!!

Thanks for helping us to bring our bundles of joy to this world doctor!!
Keep rocking and keep inspiringü§ò`,
